Challenges:
The robot's internal battery actually dying/ cannot charge with multiple chargers
The robot tends to vere to the right when just given a velocity command. (could be telop itself? or could be fixed by pd controller?)
Could not connect to the robot wirelessly due to network issues such as: no ip showing up under wlan0 and rejects adding a static ip
Having to export the ros_hostname to the local host rather than the ip directly
If the robot gets to close to the wall, it exhibits unknown behavior

Success:

The robot is able to random walk through the hallway without hitting objects with a proximity range of about a meter
When it encouters an object the robot rotates exactly 180 degress and then rotates +- a random small angle
The robot is also able to detect the wooden planks in the lab as well as the chairs most of the time
Due to the random angle the robot does not get caught in corners
